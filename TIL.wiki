= TIL =

- datasets package
  - gotcha: takes source attribute as path
  - can span multiple parquets with wildcards
  - splits to train or sth
- ollama api has explicit tools support for specific models
  - [[https://ollama.com/blog/tool-support]]
- smol 
  - (- ) loops with local gemma3:12b
    - possibly related to that ollama:gemma3 is not enlisted for tool usage
  -    memory should be possible using just the kwarg 'reset', but it's not
       happening
- llama-index
  - (++) Was the only one that worked for in the example's case without hiccups
  - (++) has built-in num-ctx for ollama
  - (+ ) most straight-forward way to describe tools
    - Also, no point in repeating name and description, as they are parsed using
      reflection from the name, signature and docstring
  - (+ ) Most stars on github, and self-claims to be the most popular
  - (+ ) lets you install integrations/extensions individually
  - (+ ) correctly assesses (?) if the model can use tools via ollama api
  - (+ ) works with llama3.2
  -    memory should be possibe using ctx=Context(alfred) and passing that as
       kwarg ctx=ctx
- langgraph
  - (++) has built-in num-ctx for ollama
  - (+ ) extensions mostly via langchain
  - (- ) llama3.2 doesn't quite work with it - none of the small models work
  -    memory is done basically by copying previous response to messages
  -    Note: ollama local model support in langchain-ollama
